#' Write the study sample sheet of the run (internal)
#'
#' AI-223: this function used to append the per-sample burden
#' (`MUTATIONS_HYPER`, `DELTAS_HYPO`, …) and `PROBES_COUNT` to the sample
#' sheet. Those columns were aggregated over the `AREA == "POSITION"` keys —
#' i.e. over every probe, with no genomic filter — which is exactly the
#' `SAMPLE` scope of the statistics sibling. They now live in
#' the `SCOPE = SAMPLE` artefacts, one row tall, and are joined back on read by
#' [sem_study_summary_get()], so the sample sheet stays the description of the
#' study.
#'
#' AI-255 brought **one** of them back here: `N_PROBES`. It is a property of the
#' imputation — how many positions of that sample survived the treatment of
#' missing values — not an aggregation of a marker over a region class, so it
#' belongs with the descriptive properties of the sample rather than in the
#' taxonomy.
