# NOTE: naming convention — `adjustment_method` (singular) is used in internal
# helpers and result-retrieval functions where a single method string is expected.
# High-level public functions (e.g. enrichment_analysis()) use `adjustment_methods`
# (plural) because they accept a vector to iterate over multiple corrections.
#
# AI-257: `area` and `scope` have no defaults. `area = "GENE"` used to be one,
# and a default is the wrong shape for this: which region class a caller wants is
# never obvious from the outside, and a caller that forgot to say got the genes
# and no indication that it had chosen anything. Every call site now declares
# what it reads. The enrichment does not call this directly at all — it goes
# through enrich_gene_set_get(), where GENE and INSTANCE are invariants rather
# than arguments.
#
# AI-257: `adjust_per_area` and `adjust_globally` are gone. They re-ran
# p.adjust() at READ time, on top of a column that is already adjusted —
# `pvalue_column` defaults to PVALUE_ADJ_ALL_BH, so switching one on meant BH
# over BH. No call site in the package ever passed TRUE. `adjust_per_area`
# additionally reused the name `area` as its loop counter, shadowing the
# parameter, so the final `subset(AREA == area)` filtered on the last area of
# the loop instead of the requested one — the function would have returned a
# different region class than the one asked for.
