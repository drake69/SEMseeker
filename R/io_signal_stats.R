#' Statistics emitted for a signal scope
#'
#' Single source of truth for which statistics a scope carries: the producer
#' composes the column names from this vector via [io_stat_colname()], and
#' [util_signal_descriptors()] builds its output on it, so the computed keys and
#' the declared vocabulary cannot drift apart.
#'
#' MODELOW / MODEHIGH only make sense on a bounded, bimodal scale (beta in
#' [0,1], the two peaks around 0 and 1). On M-values the distribution is
#' roughly gaussian and the two-mode split carries no meaning, so the columns
#' are omitted rather than filled with a meaningless number.
#'
#' **`N_PROBES` is not here (AI-255).** This vector is the vocabulary of columns
#' an artefact carries, and no artefact carries `N_PROBES` any more: it is a
#' property of the imputation — how many positions of that sample survived the
#' treatment of missing values — and it travels on `SAMPLE_SHEET_RESULT`.
#' [util_signal_descriptors()] still reports it, because a caller reducing a
#' vector legitimately wants to know how many finite values it had, but that is a
#' description of the input, not a column of the output.
#'
#' @param beta logical. TRUE when the signal is on the [0,1] beta scale.
#' @return character vector of statistic names.
#' @keywords internal
#' @noRd
