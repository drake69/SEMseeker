#' Materialise the per-sample statistics of the run
#'
#' AI-223, rewritten by AI-255. This used to produce `SAMPLE_STATS_RESULT.csv`,
#' a second kind of artefact with its own shape — samples down the rows,
#' features across the columns — and its own producer, mask and aggregation
#' code. That shape is what hid the fact that a burden over the whole sample and
#' a burden per gene are the same marker reduced over different extents.
#'
#' They are now `SCOPE = SAMPLE` artefacts: ordinary pivots, **one row tall**,
#' written by the single derivation path ([io_pivot_build()]). The readable
#' per-sample table is composed at read time by [sem_study_summary_get()], which
#' transposes them and joins them onto the sample sheet.
#'
#' This pass is therefore a **warm-up, not a requirement**: it leaves the
#' statistics of the default region class on disk at the end of a SEM run, so a
#' user who only wants the descriptive table does not pay for it later. Anything
#' it does not materialise is built on first read — which is what removed the
#' old *"produce it and rerun the analysis"*.
#'

#' Usable positions per sample, a property of the imputation (internal)
