#' Reduce one sample's signal vector to its descriptors
#'
#' Generic descriptive statistics on a numeric vector: no SEM domain knowledge,
#' no I/O. AI-223 calls it once per sample on the whole probe set (scope
#' `SAMPLE`); the region scopes reuse it unchanged on the subset of positions of
#' an area/subarea.
#'
#' The returned keys are built from [io_signal_stats()] rather than written out
#' here, so the computed statistics and the vocabulary declared to the consumer
#' cannot diverge. A statistic this function does not fill stays `NA`.
#'
#' Split at 0.5 for the two beta modes: methylation beta values are bimodal with
#' peaks near 0 (unmethylated) and near 1 (methylated), so the highest density
#' peak on each side of 0.5 is the natural estimate of each mode. On M-values the
#' distribution is unimodal and the split is meaningless, which is why
#' [io_signal_stats()] does not declare the mode columns there.
#'
#' **The numerosity guard (AI-255).** The old guard asked only for two distinct
#' points, which is what `density()` needs to run — not what the estimate needs
#' to mean something. On a handful of values the kernel bandwidth dominates and
#' "the highest peak below 0.5" is noise, but the function would still return a
#' number, and a plausible-looking number is worse than a refusal because nobody
#' goes looking for it. The taxonomy already keeps the modes at `SCOPE = SAMPLE`
#' for this reason (see [util_aggregations_allowed()]); this guard is the second
#' line, for any caller that reaches here with a small vector.
#'
#' @param values numeric vector, already filtered to finite values.
#' @param beta logical. TRUE when the signal is on the [0,1] beta scale.
#' @return named list of statistics, one element per [io_signal_stats()] entry.

#' Minimum numerosity for a two-peak density estimate (internal)

#' AI-255. A deliberate, conservative default rather than a derived quantity:
#' below roughly a hundred values a gaussian-kernel density on [0,1] is shaped
#' more by its bandwidth than by the data, and the two-peak structure the modes
#' claim to find is not identifiable. Callers that legitimately want the modes
#' work at `SCOPE = SAMPLE`, where the vector is the whole probe set of a sample
#' (tens to hundreds of thousands of values) or a region class of it (thousands),
#' so the guard never bites there.
