#' Reduce a set of values to one number, by aggregation name (internal)
#'
#' AI-248, revised by AI-255. The other half of the AGGREGATION axis:
#' [util_aggregations_allowed()] declares which names are legal for an artefact,
#' this one is the only place that says what each name *computes*. Keeping the
#' two together in one vocabulary is what stops a column called `MEDIAN` from
#' holding a mean.
#'
#' `VALUE` is the identity — the block is already a single position, there is
#' nothing to reduce. It is not a degenerate `SUM`: naming it `SUM` would invite
#' the reader to believe a reduction happened.
#'
#' `MODELOW` / `MODEHIGH` are the only distribution-shape operators: they
#' estimate the highest density peak on each side of 0.5, so they need the whole
#' distribution rather than a streaming reduce, and enough of it — they delegate
#' to [util_signal_descriptors()], which refuses below a minimum numerosity.
#'
#' AI-255 removed the `N_PROBES` branch that used to live here. The number of
#' usable positions is a property of the **imputation** — how many probes of that
#' sample survived the treatment of missing values — not an aggregation of a
#' marker, and it belongs in `SAMPLE_SHEET_RESULT` with the other descriptive
#' properties of the sample. Note that nothing is lost for the density: the
#' `MEAN` of a binary marker *is* the density, denominator included.
#'
#' @param values numeric vector. Non-finite values are dropped.
#' @param aggregation one name from [util_aggregation_vocabulary()].
#' @return a single numeric, `NA_real_` when the values do not support it.
#' @keywords internal
#' @noRd
