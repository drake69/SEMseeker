#' The pathway keys of a run, built from the hypothesis it was given (internal)
#'
#' AI-261. `util_keys_create()` used to build `keys_for_pathway` at session init
#' by rewriting the registry: every `HYPER` or `HYPO` figure became `HYPER_HYPO`
#' and every window other than `WHOLE` became `ALL_SUBAREAS`. Two consequences,
#' neither of them written anywhere. The enrichment restricted to
#' hypermethylation, and the enrichment restricted to promoters, were not
#' reachable from any argument of any exported function — and the line that
#' looked like it dropped single-figure keys on purpose could never fire, because
#' the rewrite above it had already removed every one of them.
#'
#' The keys are built here instead, from the two answers, at the point where they
#' are asked. One key per marker: the hypothesis is a property of the run, not of
#' each key, so it is stored once and stamped once.
#'
#' `AREA = "GENE"` stays an invariant rather than an argument. A pathway is a set
#' of genes; a cytoband or an island is not a member of one.
#'
#' @param epimutation_direction `"HYPER"`, `"HYPO"` or `"ANY"`.
#' @param gene_region an alias or an explicit vector of windows.
#' @param ssEnv the session environment.
#' @return `ssEnv`, with `keys_for_pathway` and `enrichment_hypothesis` set.
