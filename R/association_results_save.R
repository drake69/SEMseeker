# Symmetric counterpart to association_results_get(): writes an
# association inference CSV to the canonical path computed by

# Kept deliberately thin (no p-adjust, no SQL filtering, no annotation
# enrichment) — those belong in upstream analyzers, not in the save
# step. Call sites that currently do

#                     row.names = FALSE)
# can switch to a one-line
#   association_results_save(results_inference, inference_detail, marker, folder)
# without behaviour change.

# @param results_inference data.frame to write
