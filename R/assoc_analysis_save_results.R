#' The three nested families a p-value is adjusted over (internal)
#'
#' AI-257. The family over which an FDR is controlled is a statistical choice,
#' and it has to be readable from the column that carries the result. Until this
#' release two things made it something else:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item `assoc_apply_stat_model()` adjusted whatever `result_temp` it was
#'     handed, and at `SCOPE = INSTANCE` that is one chunk of the pivot — the
#'     family was the memory split;
#'   \item the single `PVALUE_ADJ` said nothing about its family, and at
#'     `SCOPE = SAMPLE` that family holds **one row**, so the column was equal to
#'     `PVALUE` by arithmetic while its name promised an adjustment.
#' }
#'
#' Three columns now, three families, nested, each named after its own:
#'
#' \preformatted{
#' PVALUE_ADJ_KEY_<m>    the identity key — MARKER, FIGURE, SCOPE, AREA,
#'                       SUBAREA, AGGREGATION. Members: the instances.
#' PVALUE_ADJ_SCOPE_<m>  every row of the same SCOPE. Members: the region
#'                       classes, figures and aggregations of that scope.
#' PVALUE_ADJ_ALL_<m>    the whole file. Members: everything tested on this
#'                       marker under this model.
#' }
#'
#' **Why the middle one exists.** At `SCOPE = SAMPLE` the key holds a single row,
#' so `KEY` is the raw p-value, and `ALL` puts that row in a family dominated by
#' the tens of thousands of per-instance rows it shares the file with. Neither
#' answers "how many things did I test on this sample"; `SCOPE` does.
#'
#' **Why each family is defined the same way on every row.** The tempting design
#' is a single column whose family adapts — the instances where there are
#' instances, something else where there are none. That is one name meaning two
#' things depending on the row, which is what `depth` did and what AI-255 removed
#' it for. Each of the three is one rule, applied uniformly; at
#' `SCOPE = INSTANCE` the `SCOPE` level pools genes with cytobands and islands,
#' which is a number to read with that in mind, not a number to hide.
#'
#' **They are not a severity ladder.** Benjamini-Hochberg is adaptive: enlarging
#' a family with strongly significant tests lowers the ratio `n/j` for the
#' others, since `(n+k)/(i+k) <= n/i` for every `i <= n`. A wider family is
#' usually but not necessarily more conservative. The three answer three
#' questions, and the analysis has to say which one it used.
#'
#' @param results the accumulated results of the run.
#' @param method the adjustment method as the run declared it (`ssEnv$multiple_test_adj`).
#' @param method_label the same, cleaned, as it appears in column names.
#' @param alpha the significance level, for the `q` estimator.
