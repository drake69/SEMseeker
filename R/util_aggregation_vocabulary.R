#' Every aggregation name the taxonomy knows (internal)
#'
#' AI-248, extended by AI-255. The full vocabulary of the AGGREGATION axis,
#' independent of any artefact: every name that is a name at all.
#'
#' This answers a different question from [util_aggregations_allowed()], and the
#' two must not be confused. This one is a **spell-check**: is the string the
#' caller wrote the name of an aggregation, or a typo? The other one is the
#' **semantic** check: is this operator meaningful for *this* artefact. A
#' validator needs both, in that order — a helpful error for `"MEDAIN"` ("not a
#' name we know") is not the same as the error for `MODELOW` per instance ("a
#' real name, wrong scope").
#'
#' It exists as its own function because the callers used to obtain the union by
#' asking `util_aggregations_allowed("SIGNAL", "BETA", ...)` — the one pair that
#' happens to admit everything. That worked, but it read as an assumption about
#' the scale of the session, which it never was.
