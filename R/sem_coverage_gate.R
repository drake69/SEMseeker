#' Mandatory coverage check run before every SEM analysis (internal)
#'
#' AI-074. Coverage used to be an opt-in report: any pipeline path could go
#' straight to the SEM rebuild on signal data that has little or no overlap
#' with the reference annotation (Nanopore input against an Illumina manifest,
#' a batch with a probe mismatch, the wrong genome build). The run then
#' produced thresholds computed on a handful of probes and every downstream
#' number was quietly wrong.
#'
#' This gate always runs, in this order:
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item the coverage charts (\code{\link{sem_coverage_analysis}}) are
#'     generated on EVERY run, whatever the verdict — they are the artefact the
#'     analyst reads to understand what was covered;
#'   \item a global coverage percentage (input positions found in the reference
#'     annotation) is logged as a BANNER and written to a JSON sidecar for
#'     later audit;
#'   \item the run STOPS when coverage is below \code{coverage_minimum}
#'     (default 80\%), naming the numbers involved.
#' }
#'
#' Coordinate-based technologies (WGBS / long reads) derive their annotation
#' from the positions themselves, so the overlap is 100\% by construction and
#' the threshold is not applied; the charts are still attempted and the JSON
#' sidecar still written, with \code{gate = "skipped"}.
#'
#' @param observed_probes character. Probe / position identifiers of the input.
#' @param tech character. Technology label; defaults to the session value.
#'
#' @return Invisibly the list of coverage metrics.
