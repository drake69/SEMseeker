#' Compose the on-disk name of a pivot (internal)
#'
#' AI-248, rewritten by AI-255. The file name of a pivot **is** its identity key
#' ([io_artefact_key()]) plus an extension: a pivot copied out of its folder and
#' attached to a mail still says what it is.
#'
#' \preformatted{
#' <MARKER>_<FIGURE>_<SCOPE>_<AREA>_<SUBAREA>_<AGGREGATION>_<build>.parquet
#'
#' MUTATIONS_HYPER_SAMPLE_PROBE_WHOLE_SUM_HG19.parquet
#' DELTAS_HYPO_INSTANCE_GENE_TSS200_MEDIAN_HG19.parquet
#' SIGNAL_BETA_INSTANCE_PROBE_WHOLE_VALUE_HG19.parquet
#' }
#'
#' The aggregation is in the name because before AI-248 the name did **not** say
#' which operator had produced the file: an existing pivot was reused on trust.
#' With one operator per marker that trust was justified; with several it is the
#' worst kind of bug — silent, because the file is there and the run does not
#' complain while a mean is consumed as if it were a sum.
#'
#' The scope is in the name because AI-255 made it a coordinate: a burden over
#' the whole sample and a burden per gene are the same marker reduced over
#' different extents, and used to live in files of different *shape* — a CSV
#' sibling and a pivot — which is what hid the difference.
#'
#' @param marker,figure,area,subarea the region class and the quantity.
#' @param aggregation the AGGREGATION axis. `NULL` is resolved to `"VALUE"` when
#'   the block is already a single position (`PROBE`/`POSITION` at
#'   `SCOPE = INSTANCE`), where `VALUE` is the only meaningful operator, and is
#'   an error anywhere else: a block holding many positions was reduced somehow,
#'   and the name has to say how.
#' @param scope `"INSTANCE"` (default, one row per instance) or `"SAMPLE"` (one
#'   row, the whole extent collapsed).
#' @param add_gz passed through for the CSV flavour.
