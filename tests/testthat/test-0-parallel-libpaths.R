# AI-184 (2026-06-26): multisession/cluster workers are fresh R processes
# spawned via parallelly::makeClusterPSOCK. When the parent runs under `renv`,
# those workers must inherit the parent .libPaths() (which includes the renv
# project library) or they silently die at the first library() lookup — no
# R-visible error reaches the parent log. The fix in parallel_session() passes
# `rscript_libs = .libPaths()` to the multisession/cluster plans.
#
# This test asserts the contract end-to-end: after parallel_session() sets up a
# multisession plan, a worker future reports the SAME .libPaths() as the parent.
