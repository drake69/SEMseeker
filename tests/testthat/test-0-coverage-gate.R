## AI-074 — coverage is a mandatory pre-step of every SEM analysis.
##
## Three contracts, in decreasing order of importance:
##   1. the coverage charts are produced on EVERY run, including the runs the
##      gate rejects — they are the artefact the analyst reads;
##   2. the run STOPS when the input barely overlaps the reference annotation,
##      with a message naming the numbers;
##   3. coverage_minimum lowers the bar explicitly for deliberate
##      cross-technology runs.
##
## Session tests use tempFolders indices 10-12.
