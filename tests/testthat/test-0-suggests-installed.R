# AI-096 Phase 2 (2026-06-09): meta-test — every package referenced by
# `skip_if_not_installed("...")` (or `testthat::skip_if_not_installed`)
# MUST actually be installed in the test environment.
#
# Why this exists:
#   `skip_if_not_installed(pkg)` silently skips the enclosing test if
#   `pkg` is missing. This is the correct testthat idiom for optional
#   features (Suggests deps). BUT it has a failure mode: if the CI
#   pipeline forgets to install `pkg`, the test silently skips and the
#   CI goes green WITHOUT exercising the feature. Coverage looks fine,
#   but a whole engine (limma_2, voom_2, binomial_bulk, ...) goes
#   untested.
#
#   This meta-test scans every test-*.R file under tests/testthat/,
#   extracts the package names referenced inside skip_if_not_installed()
#   calls, and asserts they are all installed. If any is missing, the
#   test FAILS with a list of (package, test file) pairs so the operator
#   knows exactly which CI install step to add.
#
#   Convention enforced: every Suggests dep used in tests MUST be in the
#   CI install list (.github/workflows/R-CMD-check.yml +
#   .github/workflows/test-coverage.yml). The CI workflows have a
#   comment naming each test that exercises each Suggests; this meta-test
#   keeps that comment in sync with reality.
