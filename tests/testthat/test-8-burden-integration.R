# AI-086: integration test for the per-sample burden.
#
# AI-223 moved the burden out of SAMPLE_SHEET_RESULT.csv and into the
# statistics sibling SAMPLE_STATS_RESULT.csv, where it is named
# SAMPLE_<MARKER>_<FIGURE> (PROBES_COUNT became SAMPLE_N_PROBES). This test
# follows it there, and additionally asserts that the sample sheet is left
# lean.
#
# Canary for AI-083: the burden aggregation failed to populate per-sample
# values on ewas_osteoporosis/GSE99624 (48 samples, 450K) — all burden columns
# landed as NA, which then crashed every depth=1 inference downstream with
# "data are not the same size".
#
# test-7-association_analysis.R only verifies this indirectly (depth=1 would
# fail on all-NA burden vectors); this test asserts the contract directly:
#
#   1. sample_sheet_result.csv exists after semseeker().
#   2. Every expected <MARKER>_<FIGURE> burden column is PRESENT.
#   3. Every burden column has at least one non-NA sample.
#   4. No sample has ALL burden values NA (per-sample BED collection works).
#   5. PROBES_COUNT > 0 on every sample.
#   6. Sanity: injected hypomethylated outliers surface as MUTATIONS_HYPO > 0.
#
# Why discrete markers only: sem_study_summary_total() iterates AREA=="POSITION"
# keys, which is the set declared in keys_create.R via
# keys_markers_default_discrete (MUTATIONS / LESIONS / DELTAQ / DELTARQ /
# DELTAP / DELTARP) plus the two continuous DELTAS / DELTAR. LESIONS depends
# on MUTATIONS having been computed (SOURCE column), so the full
# (MUTATIONS + DELTA*) set exercises the whole derive-and-aggregate path.

#       ewas_osteoporosis/GSE99624 case was "DNAm_sample1" -> "DNAM_SAMPLE1";
#   (b) a `temp_result` object left in the global environment. The old code
#       used exists("temp_result"), which resolves through globalenv(). This
#       is NOT sufficient on its own to produce the reported symptom (the
#       inner merge uses all=TRUE, so a stray object only adds a spurious row),
#       but the accumulator must be a local binding regardless;
#   (c) the condition that DOES produce the reported symptom — a burden table
#       sharing no Sample_ID with the sample sheet, which used to yield 100% NA
#       burden columns and killed every depth=1 inference downstream with
#       "data are not the same size". Since AI-223 the aggregation lives in
#       sem_sample_stats_build(), which must refuse to write that file.
