# Volcano plot of association results for one inference_detail row.

Reads the inference CSV that corresponds to the given
\`inference_detail\` row (already written by \`association_analysis()\`
into \`\<result_folder\>/Inference/\`), splits it by \`(AREA,
SUBAREA)\`, and produces one PNG volcano per combination under
\`\<result_folder\>/Chart/VOLCANO/\`. Naming mirrors the inference CSV
convention so the visual artifact is one-to-one traceable to the
analytic output:

## Usage

``` r
assoc_volcano_plot_inference(
  inference_detail,
  result_folder,
  markers = NULL,
  pvalue_column = NULL,
  alpha = 0.05,
  top_n_label = 20L,
  width = 9,
  height = 9,
  units = "in",
  dpi = NULL,
  overwrite = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- inference_detail:

  A single row of \`inference_details\` (data.frame or list) — the same
  shape consumed by \`association_analysis()\`. Must carry
  \`independent_variable\`, \`family_test\`, \`covariates\`,
  \`covariates_dummy\`, \`transformation_y\`, \`depth_analysis\`,
  \`areas_sql_condition\`, \`samples_sql_condition\`.

- result_folder:

  Project results folder (e.g. \`~/.../results/GSE225845\`). The
  function reads CSVs from \`\<result_folder\>/Inference/\` and writes
  PNGs under \`\<result_folder\>/Chart/VOLCANO/\`.

- markers:

  Character vector of marker names to plot for this scheda (e.g.
  \`c("SIGNAL","DELTARP","DELTARQ")\` for limma_2 PROBE). If NULL,
  inferred from the CSVs that exist in \`Inference/\` matching this
  scheda's metadata.

- alpha:

  Significance threshold drawn as a horizontal dashed line at
  \`-log10(alpha)\`. Points with \`PVALUE_ADJ \<= alpha\` are coloured
  red (significant), the rest grey (non-significant). Default 0.05.

- top_n_label:

  How many of the top-significant points (by lowest \`PVALUE_ADJ\`) get
  an \`AREA_OF_TEST\` text label. Default 20. Set to 0 to disable
  labels.

- width, height, units:

  Passed to \`ggplot2::ggsave()\`. Default 9 × 9 inches.

- dpi:

  Plot resolution. Defaults to \`ssEnv\$plot_resolution_ppi\` (typically
  600).

- overwrite:

  If FALSE (default) skip PNGs that already exist.

## Value

Invisibly, a character vector of the PNG paths written (or that would
have been written, when \`overwrite = FALSE\` and the file already
exists).

## Details

\`MARKER_DEPTH_depth_IV_transformation_y_family_covariates_areas_sql_condition_AREA_SUBAREA.png\`

(passed through \`core_name_cleaning()\` which uppercases + replaces
comparison operators with \`\_GT\_\` / \`\_LT\_\` / \`\_EQ\_\` etc.)

## Examples

``` r
# Stub: see vignette('imprinting-disorders', package = 'SEMseeker') for a
# runnable Beckwith-Wiedemann workflow on the GSE133774 subset (AI-112b).
invisible(NULL)
