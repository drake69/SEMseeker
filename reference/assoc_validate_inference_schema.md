# Validate the schema of inference_details (strict, with helpful errors)

Two responsibilities:

## Usage

``` r
assoc_validate_inference_schema(inference_details, strict = TRUE)
```

## Arguments

- inference_details:

  data.frame from the user.

- strict:

  Whether to error on unknown columns (\`TRUE\`, default, recommended)
  or just warn (\`FALSE\`, lenient mode for back-compat).

## Value

data.frame with all expected columns present (NA where missing).

## Details

1\. \*\*Fill missing optional columns\*\* with NA, so downstream code
can always reference them without \`is.null()\` checks. 2. \*\*Reject
unknown columns\*\* with a clear diagnostic — including a fuzzy-match
suggestion when the unknown name is close to an expected one (typical
case: typo in setup like \`phenolyser\` vs \`phenolyzer\`, or
\`areas_sql_condtion\` vs \`areas_sql_condition\`).

The vocabulary of legal columns is the source of truth for what the
package accepts from the user. Any new user-input column must be
registered here.
