# Build a GRanges object for a given genomic area/subarea

Constructs the same region boundaries used by Illumina array annotation
(TSS200, TSS1500, gene body, CpG islands, shores, shelves …) from TxDb
packages and AnnotationHub, so that WGBS and long-read analyses share
identical region semantics with Illumina array analyses.

## Usage

``` r
anno_area_granges_build(area_subarea, genome_build = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- area_subarea:

  Character scalar: area and subarea joined by `"_"` (e.g.
  `"GENE_BODY"`, `"ISLAND_N_SHORE"`, `"CHR_CYTOBAND"`).

- genome_build:

  Character scalar: reference assembly. Defaults to `ssEnv$genome_build`
  (set by
  [`core_init_env`](https://drake69.github.io/semseeker/reference/core_init_env.md)),
  or `"hg19"` if the session is not initialised.

## Value

A `GRanges` object. `mcols(gr)$label` contains the subarea identifier
used downstream to group CpGs (gene symbol, island coordinate, cytoband
name, etc.).

## Details

Results are cached in memory for the duration of the R session to avoid
repeated package loads. CpG island tracks downloaded from AnnotationHub
are also cached on disk in `tools::R_user_dir("SEMseeker", "cache")`.

## PROBE_WHOLE semantics by technology

`PROBE_WHOLE` is **not** handled by this function. It is resolved inline
by
[`anno_probe_features_get`](https://drake69.github.io/semseeker/reference/anno_probe_features_get.md):

- **Illumina**: one row per array probe (manufacturer ID, e.g.
  `cg00000029`). Probe identity is meaningful and cross-study comparable
  for the same array platform.

- **WGBS / LONGREAD**: treated as `POSITION_WHOLE` — one row per genomic
  position encoded as `"CHR\_START"` (e.g. `"1\_10000"`). Cross-study
  comparisons require the same `genome_build`.

## Required packages

Install via
[`BiocManager::install()`](https://bioconductor.github.io/BiocManager/reference/install.html).

- GENE areas:

  `TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene` (or hg38/mm10), `GenomicFeatures`,
  `GenomicRanges`, `IRanges`. `org.Hs.eg.db` is optional (falls back to
  Entrez IDs as labels).

- ISLAND areas:

  `AnnotationHub` (downloads track on first use, then caches locally).

- CHR / DMR areas:

  no extra packages needed.
